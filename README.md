# Flood zoning map and site selection using fuzzy logic
# Project Title

## Introduction
This project uses the Simplified Fuzzy Method for decision-making. The rules are generated based on the specific requirements of the project. The results of this method were compared with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method witihn study, and the outcomes were satisfactory.

## Methodology
The Simplified Fuzzy Method was employed in this project. This method is a variant of Fuzzy Logic, a mathematical method for handling uncertainty and vagueness in decision-making. The rules for this method were specifically tailored for this project.

The results of the Simplified Fuzzy Method were compared with the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. AHP is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions. The comparison showed that the Simplified Fuzzy Method produced satisfactory results.

## Tools Used
The project was implemented using ArcPy for Python 2.7. ArcPy is a Python site package that provides a useful and productive way to perform geographic data analysis, data conversion, data management, and map automation with Python.

## File Structure
The files from the source data are assumed to be in the same path as the project file. Please ensure that the file paths are correctly set up to avoid any errors.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of the Simplified Fuzzy Method in decision-making. The comparison with the AHP method showed satisfactory results, indicating that the Simplified Fuzzy
